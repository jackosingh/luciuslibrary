29-12-2025 8:40:48,,Animal model and neurobiology of suicide,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21354241/,"When modeling suicidal behavior in the animal, the greatest challenge is reproducing the role of will and intention in suicide mechanics. To overcome this limitation, current investigations on animals focus on every single step leading to suicide in humans. The most promising endophenotypes worth investigating in animals are the cortisol social-stress response and the aggression/impulsivity trait, involving the serotonergic system. Astroglia, neurotrophic factors and neurotrophins are implied in suicide, too. ",Animal Suïcide
