          <small>When modeling suicidal behavior in the animal, the greatest challenge is reproducing the role of will and intention in suicide mechanics. To overcome this limitation, current investigations on animals focus on every single step leading to suicide in humans. The most promising endophenotypes worth investigating in animals are the cortisol social-stress response and the aggression/impulsivity trait, involving the serotonergic system. Astroglia, neurotrophic factors and neurotrophins are implied in suicide, too. </small>

          <small>However, is it effective? In this review article, we analyzed over 50 clinical studies in which IF, conducted by alternate day fasting (ADF) or time-restricted feeding (TRF), was compared with the caloric restriction approach. We evaluated the different roles of IF in treating and preventing human disorders such as metabolic syndrome, type II diabetes, and some types of cancer, as well as the usefulness of IF in reducing body weight and cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension. Furthermore, we explored the cellular pathways targeted by IF to exert their beneficial effects by activating effector proteins that modulate cell functions and resistance to oxidative stress.</small>

          <small>This review is the first to examine potential correlates of meal skipping in young adults. Lack of time was consistently reported as an important correlate of meal skipping, compared with correlates such as cost and weight control, while sex was the most commonly reported associated correlate. Breakfast skipping was more common among men while lunch or dinner skipping being more common among women.</small>

          <small>Health care professionals often use numbers to guide decisions, monitor patient health, and communicate information. Although nonnumeric conversations may be recommended for some situations (eg, many cancer screening decisions),1 providing numerical information, especially when requested by patients, may be helpful in shared decision-making.</small>

          <small>For adults with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) caused by mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene, long-term treatment with tofersen (Qalsody, Biogen) was associated with slowed disease progression, longer survival, and improved muscle strength in some patients, final data from the VALOR study and its open-label extension (OLE) show.</small>

          <small>Question  What are the long-term effects of early-start and placebo/delayed-start tofersen treatment in adults with SOD1 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)?

Findings  This integrated analysis of the phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled VALOR study and its open-label extension (OLE) found that participants with earlier initiation of tofersen exhibited numerically less decline in function, strength, and risk of death-equivalent events than participants in the placebo/delayed-start group (tofersen initiated approximately 6 months later), consistent with a slowing of disease progression. No new safety concerns were identified with long-term exposure to tofersen.

Meaning  Final data from VALOR and its OLE demonstrated the benefit of tofersen treatment for adults with SOD1-ALS and provide a clear rationale for starting therapy in this population.</small>

          <small>This paper reviews recent developments in the neurocircuitry and neurobiology of addiction from a perspective of allostasis. The view that addiction is the pathology that results from an allostatic mechanism using the circuits established for natural rewards provides a realistic approach to identifying the neurobiological factors that produce vulnerability to addiction and relapse.</small>
